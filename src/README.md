## Board and game
To use different `move(board, player)` function to play the game,
pass it to the `game` constructor as `first_move_maker` argument or
`second_move_maker` argument.
See the code in `main.py` for example.


## ignore this
The `random_player_clone.py` and `random_player_for_input_player` is to help
importing same module as different modules to resolve global variable
accessing conflict.
